# JS Refactoring Kata

JES Monthly Coding Dojo

# Styleguide

We follow the styleguide of https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

# Task

Refactor the following code based on our styleguide.
You can try to find all issues on your own or use the linter to display almost every error.
Everything in the src folder can be refactored.

## Advice for refactoring

- Refactor the code in small steps so that you will have always executable code (code can be executed after the kata duration)
- You can also use the linter as additional result validation
- You can also do a short design phase

## Help

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies of the repository
2. Run `npm run execute` to execute the code and see the console output.
3. Run `npm run lint` to see all the linting errors, which needs to be refactored based on our guidelines
4. Run `npm run execute` again to see that your refactoring does not change the console output
